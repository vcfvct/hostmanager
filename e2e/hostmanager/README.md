`Protractor` runs asynchronously, but it takes care to synchronize the test steps with your application, so that they will be executed properly, and the right time, only when the application is ready and has processed the previous step. All the actions (mouse clicks, keyboard typing, etc.) and all the checks / expectations actually return promises, that will be executed some time in the future. 

At the start of your tests, all of your test scripts are parsed and a chain of promises is created. After that, they begin to execute one after another - protractor takes care for that. It also takes care to synchronize your test steps (actions, expectations, etc.) with angular in your application under test. So after each step (promise), it automatically calls `waitForAngular` - no need to do that yourself. This way, you can write the steps in a synchronous matter, but they will be executed asynchronously, at the right time. However, this is not entirely true - protractor is a wrapper over webdriverjs - so all protractor methods are automatically synced, but you are also able to call webdriver methods directly and they will not be synced. 

You can check which are the protractor and which are the webdriverjs methods available in the documentation here - http://www.protractortest.org/#/api
